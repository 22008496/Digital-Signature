# Digital-Signature
# Aim: To write a C program to implement the signature scheme named digital signature standard (Euclidean Algorithm).
# Date :
# Register No.
# Algorithm:
STEP-1: Alice and Bob are investigating a forgery case of x and y.
STEP-2: X had document signed by him but he says he did not sign that document digitally.
STEP-3: Alice reads the two prime numbers p and a.
STEP-4: He chooses a random co-primes alpha and beta and the x’s original signature x.
STEP-5: With these values, he applies it to the elliptic curve cryptographic equation to obtain y.
STEP-6: Comparing this ‘y’ with actual y’s document, Alice concludes that y is a forgery.
